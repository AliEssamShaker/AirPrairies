# AirPrairies
A software engineering course project.

This is a web page of an imaginary airline company that I developed with the help of my team in my software engineering course. The page is quite dynamic and responsive, and it enables the user to select an origin and destination, dates of travel, search for flights, choose a flight, fill out personal information, receive a confirmation to their preferred or indicated personal email, and also look up their recent bookings using their unique confirmation ID.

I was responsible for all the backend work along with another teammate. And I build the database and tested it thoroughly, moreover, I implemented the logic of the search engine and quering from the database the right output according the user's search input, as well as displaying the results in the correct order and sense. I also contributed in some of the structural design of the page, as well as the general idea.

We used Nodejs, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQlite.

Our team followed Agile methodology throughout the process. We had about 12 milestones, where we had lots of reports to write, do user stories, epics, and so on all the way to the final Aplha and Beta phases. It was overall a remarkable experience, and I certainly learned a lot.
